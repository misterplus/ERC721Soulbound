## BrightIDSoulbound

A proof of concept inspired by Vitalik Buterin's article titled [Soulbound](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) and a forum post by Triplespeeder titled [Implementing Soulbound NFTs with BrightID](https://forum.brightid.org/t/implementing-soulbound-nfts-with-brightid/430).

Note that this is only a PROOF OF CONCEPT, security issues not related to BrightID and it's verification system are not taken into consideration.

## Registry Extensions
